# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

### `npm run build` fails to minify

This section has moved here: [https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/troubleshooting#npm-run-build-fails-to-minify](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/troubleshooting#npm-run-build-fails-to-minify)

1。 css文件要先import进来，可以在APP.js import，也可以在子的js中import，如果不import，那么样式不生效
2。map的一定要指定一个key

3。return只能返回一个对象，实践就是把所有的比如输入框，按钮，子div等都放到一个大的div里面返回
4。函数变量赋值需要在{}中
5。  const [ toDoList, setToDoList ] = useState(data);
     setToDoList(mapped) is analogous to this.setState({ toDoList: mapped }), which was used when we worked with state in class components.
mapped是已匹配的数据集,useState返回两个变量，一个是当前的数据集，另一个是该数据集的set函数，该函数的变量是一个数据集
6。
<ToDoList toDoList={toDoList} setToDoList={setToDoList}  handleToggle={handleToggle}  handleFilter={handleFilter}/>

可以用这个方式在APP.js中把参数(变量或者函数(在APP.js中定义))传递给引用的函数ToDoList
